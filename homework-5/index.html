                <p>It was formed on 25 April 1952 by the unification of the western federal states of Württemberg-Baden
                    , South Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern , which were under the occupation of England , France and
                    the United States . Baden-Württemberg is the state with the highest level of exports (2019),
                    with a low unemployment rate and the
                    fourth highest gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita (2020). In terms of life expectancy,
                    both for men and women , Baden-Württemberg ranked first among the federal
                    states of Germany for the period 2018-2020 . In terms of population and area,
                    Baden-Württemberg ranks third among the states of Germany.</p>
                <p>The state consists of a union of several historical states of the German region of Swabia : Baden ,
                    Hohenzollern and Württemberg .After World War II, the Allies created three states:
                    Württemberg-Hohenzollern , South Baden (both
                    occupied by France ), and Württemberg-Baden (occupied by the United States ). In 1949, these three
                    states became part of the Federal Republic of Germany . Article 118 of the FRG constitution allowed
                    the three regions to unite. Following a plebiscite on 9 December 1951 , these regions were united on
                    25 April 1952 to form the state of Baden-Württemberg.</p>
